				<h2>Now Showing</h2>
				The hugely anticipated new film from writer/director Céline Sciamma (Tomboy, Water Lilies), 
				GIRLHOOD is a sensational story of female empowerment set in the tough neighbourhoods 
				of Paris.,Mariame (an incendiary, star-making performance from Karidja Touré) is a shy 16-year-old
				who lives with her mostly absent mother, a domineering older brother, and two younger sisters of whom 
				she largely takes responsibility for caring. Left behind at high school where she’s told her grades are
				too poor to continue, Mariame is soon lured out of her shell by three vivacious neighborhood teens. 
				Enthralled by their bravado and brash energy, Mariame quickly adopts their flashier look and adapts 
				to their bolder and often reckless behavior, making both foolish and brave choices as she struggles 
				towards independence.,Depicting a side of Paris unseen from the top of the Eiffel Tower, GIRLHOOD 
				finds irresistible energy in these young characters for whom attitude is everything. Featuring sumptuous 
				cinematography and a jubilant soundtrack, the film builds momentum with every scene, and exudes life 
				from every frame.
